10/29/23: joined study group with Brandon, Samantha, Michael, Irene, and Brian to continue working on the homework. We collaborated to fix issues with our per_school_summary dataframe and then continued to collaborate on the remainder homework as well, minus the analysis. 
Also periodically consulted chatGPT to assist with some errors that I got and couldn't diagnose myself.
